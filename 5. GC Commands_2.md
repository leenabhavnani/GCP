### Commands

##### Task 1. Set up Terraform and Cloud Shell
- In the Cloud Console, click Activate Cloud Shell (Activate Cloud Shell icon).
If prompted, click Continue.
To confirm that Terraform is installed, run the following command:
  > terraform --version
- To create a directory for your Terraform configuration, run the following command:
  > mkdir tfinfra
- In Cloud Shell, click Open editor (Cloud Shell Editor icon).
**Note:** If you see the message "Unable to load code editor because third-party cookies are disabled", click Open in New Window. The code editor will open in a new tab. Return to the original tab, click Open Terminal and then switch back to the code editor tab. You will periodically need to switch back to the Cloud Shell terminal in this lab.
In the left pane of the code editor, expand the tfinfra folder.

##### Initialize Terraform
- Terraform uses a plugin-based architecture to support the numerous infrastructure and service providers available. Each "provider" is its own encapsulated binary distributed separately from Terraform itself. Initialize Terraform by setting Google as the provider.
- To create a new file inside tfinfra folder, right-click on tfinfra folder and then click New File.
Name the new file provider.tf, and then open it.
Copy the code into provider.tf:
  > provider "google" {}
- To save provider.tf, click File > Save.
To initialize Terraform, run the following command:
  > cd tfinfra
  > terraform init
  
  The output should look like this:

You are now ready to work with Terraform in Cloud Shell.

##### Task 2. Create mynetwork and its resources
- Create a new configuration, and define mynetwork.
- To create a new file inside tfinfra, right-click on tfinfra folder and then click New File.
Name the new file mynetwork.tf, and then open it.
Copy the following base code into mynetwork.tf:
  
    ```
        # Create the mynetwork network
        resource "google_compute_network" "mynetwork" {
        name = "mynetwork"
        # RESOURCE properties go here
        auto_create_subnetworks = "true"
      }

- Define a firewall rule to allow HTTP, SSH, RDP, and ICMP traffic on mynetwork.
- Add the following base code to mynetwork.tf:  
- In mynetwork.tf, replace [RESOURCE_TYPE] with "google_compute_firewall" (with the quotes).
- In mynetwork.tf, replace [RESOURCE_NAME] with "mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp" (with the quotes).
- Add the following property to mynetwork.tf:
  >  network = google_compute_network.mynetwork.self_link
  
- Add the following properties to mynetwork.tf:
  ```
        # Create the mynetwork network
      resource "google_compute_network" "mynetwork" {
      name = "mynetwork"
      # RESOURCE properties go here
      auto_create_subnetworks = "true"
      }
      # Add a firewall rule to allow HTTP, SSH, RDP and ICMP traffic on mynetwork
      resource "google_compute_firewall" "mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp" {
      name = "mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp"
    # RESOURCE properties go here
    network = google_compute_network.mynetwork.self_link
    # The list of allow rules specifies which protocols and ports are permitted.
    allow {
        protocol = "tcp"
        ports    = ["22", "80", "3389"]
        }
    allow {
        protocol = "icmp"
        }
    source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }

- To create a new folder inside tfinfra, select the tfinfra folder, and then click File > New Folder.
- Name the new folder instance.
- To create a new file inside instance, right-click on instance folder and then click New File.
Name the new file main.tf, and then open it.
- Copy the following base code into main.tf:
  ```
        resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
    name         = "${var.instance_name}"
    zone         = "${var.instance_zone}"
    machine_type = "${var.instance_type}"
   # These properties define the zone and machine type of the instance as input variables.
   # This property defines the boot disk to use the Debian 11 OS image.
    boot_disk {
      initialize_params {
        image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
        }
    }
   # This property defines the network interface by providing the network name as an input variable and the access configuration.
    network_interface {
      network = "${var.instance_network}"
      access_config {
        # Allocate a one-to-one NAT IP to the instance
      }
    }
  }

- To create a new file inside instance, right-click on instance folder and then click New File. Name the new file variables.tf, and then open it. Define the 4 input variables in variables.tf.
  
    ``` variable "instance_name" {}
  variable "instance_zone" {}
  variable "instance_type" {
    default = "e2-micro"
    }
  variable "instance_network" {}

- Add the  VM instances to mynetwork.tf
  ```
        # Create the mynetwork network
    resource "google_compute_network" "mynetwork" {
    name = "mynetwork"
    # RESOURCE properties go here
    auto_create_subnetworks = "true"
    }
    # Add a firewall rule to allow HTTP, SSH, RDP and ICMP traffic on mynetwork
    resource "google_compute_firewall" "mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp" {
    name = "mynetwork-allow-http-ssh-rdp-icmp"
    # RESOURCE properties go here
    network = google_compute_network.mynetwork.self_link
    allow {
        protocol = "tcp"
        ports    = ["22", "80", "3389"]
        }
    allow {
        protocol = "icmp"
        }
    source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
    # Create the mynet-us-vm instance
    module "mynet-us-vm" {
      source           = "./instance"
      instance_name    = "mynet-us-vm"
      instance_zone    = "us-east5-a"
      instance_network = google_compute_network.mynetwork.self_link
    }
    # Create the mynet-eu-vm" instance
    module "mynet-eu-vm" {
      source           = "./instance"
      instance_name    = "mynet-eu-vm"
      instance_zone    = "europe-west1-d"
      instance_network = google_compute_network.mynetwork.self_link
    }
