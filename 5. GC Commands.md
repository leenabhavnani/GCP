### Commands

####  Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the gcloud storage command line

- Enter your chosen location into an environment variable called LOCATION. 
  > export LOCATION=US
- the DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID environment variable contains your project ID. Enter this command to make a bucket named after your project ID:
  > gcloud storage buckets create -l $LOCATION gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
- Retrieve a banner image from a publicly accessible Cloud Storage location:
  > gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfci/my-excellent-blog.png my-excellent-blog.png
- Copy the banner image to your newly created Cloud Storage bucket
  > gcloud storage cp my-excellent-blog.png gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png
- Modify the Access Control List of the object you just created so that it's readable by everyone:
  > gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png
  
#### Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster

- Click the Activate Cloud Shell button.
- Type the following command to export the environment variable called MY_ZONE.
   > export MY_ZONE="us-west3-a"
- Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:
   > gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
- After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:
   > kubectl version
- Launch a single instance of the nginx container. (Nginx is a popular web server.)
   > kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10
- View the pod running the nginx container
   > kubectl get pods
- Expose the nginx container to the Internet:
   > kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
- It may take a few seconds before the External-IP field is populated for your service. This is normal. Just re-run the kubectl get services command every few seconds until the field is populated.
- Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.
- Scale up the number of pods running on your service:
   > kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
- Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
   > kubectl get pods
- Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
   > kubectl get services
