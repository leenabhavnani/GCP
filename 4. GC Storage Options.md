### Notes 

#### Cloud Storage

- Object storage is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as “objects”
- Cloud Storage’s primary use is whenever binary large-object storage (also known as a “BLOB”) is needed for online content such as videos and photos, for backup and archived data and for storage of intermediate results in processing workflows.
- A new version is created with every change made.
- If you need finer control, you can create **access control lists**. Each access control list consists of two pieces of information. The first is a **scope**, which defines who can access and perform an action.
- This can be a specific user or group of users. The second is a **permission**, which defines what actions can be performed, like read or write.

- **Standard Storage** is considered best for frequently accessed, or “hot,” data.
- **Nearline Storage** is best for storing infrequently accessed data.
- **Coldline Storage** is meant for reading or modifying data, at most, once every 90 days.
- **Archive Storage**  is the lowest-cost option, used ideally for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery. It’s the best choice for data that you plan to access less than once a year,
- Cloud Storage always encrypts data on the server side, before it’s written to disk, at no additional charge.
- **Storage Transfer Service** enables you to import large amounts of online data into Cloud Storage quickly and cost-effectively.
- **Transfer Appliance**, which is a rackable, high-capacity storage server that you lease from Google Cloud.

#### Cloud SQL

- Cloud SQL offers fully managed relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server as a service.
- Can scale up to 64 processor cores, 400+ GB of RAM, and 30 TB of storage.
- The cost of an instance covers seven backups.

#### Cloud Spanner

- Cloud Spanner is a fully managed relational database service that scales horizontally, is strongly consistent, and speaks SQL.
- High numbers of input and output operations per second. We’re talking tens of thousands of reads and writes per second or more.

#### Firestore

- Firestore is a flexible, horizontally scalable, NoSQL cloud database for mobile, web, and server development.
- Automatic multi-region data replication, strong consistency guarantees, atomic batch operations, and real transaction support.
- You’re charged for each document read, write, and delete that you perform with Firestore.
- Queries are also charged at the rate of one “document read” per query, whether the query returns data or not
- Firestore has a free quota per day of: 50,000 document reads, 20,000 document writes, 20,000 document deletes, and 1 GB of stored data.

#### Cloud Bigtable

- Cloud Bigtable is Google's NoSQL big data database service.
- Great choice for both operational and analytical applications, including Internet of Things, user analytics, and financial data analysis.
