### Commands

####  Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the gcloud storage command line

- Enter your chosen location into an environment variable called LOCATION. 
  > export LOCATION=US
- the DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID environment variable contains your project ID. Enter this command to make a bucket named after your project ID:
  > gcloud storage buckets create -l $LOCATION gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
- Retrieve a banner image from a publicly accessible Cloud Storage location:
  > gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfci/my-excellent-blog.png my-excellent-blog.png
- Copy the banner image to your newly created Cloud Storage bucket
  > gcloud storage cp my-excellent-blog.png gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png
- Modify the Access Control List of the object you just created so that it's readable by everyone:
  > gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png
  
#### Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster

- Click the Activate Cloud Shell button.
- Type the following command to export the environment variable called MY_ZONE.
   > export MY_ZONE="us-west3-a"
- Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:
   > gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
- After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:
   > kubectl version
- Launch a single instance of the nginx container. (Nginx is a popular web server.)
   > kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10
- View the pod running the nginx container
   > kubectl get pods
- Expose the nginx container to the Internet:
   > kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
- It may take a few seconds before the External-IP field is populated for your service. This is normal. Just re-run the kubectl get services command every few seconds until the field is populated.
- Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.
- Scale up the number of pods running on your service:
   > kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
- Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
   > kubectl get pods
- Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
   > kubectl get services
  
#### Hello Cloud Run 
- You can list the active account name with this command:
   > gcloud auth list
- You can list the project ID with this command:
   > gcloud config list project
- Below you will find a reference list of a few very basic Linux commands
  ![image](https://github.com/leenabhavnani/GCP/assets/61199820/2d4af515-ec74-4441-a30a-aab452d7945d)

- From Cloud Shell, enable the Cloud Run API
   > gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
- Set the compute region and Create a LOCATION environment variable:
   > gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
   > LOCATION="us-central1"
- In Cloud Shell create a new directory named helloworld, then move your view into that directory:
   > mkdir helloworld && cd helloworld
- Next you'll be creating and editing files. To edit files, use vi, emac, nano or the Cloud Shell Code Editor by clicking on the Open Editor button in Cloud Shell. Create a package.json file, then add the following content to it:
   > nano package.json
    ``` {
      "name": "helloworld",
      "description": "Simple hello world sample in Node",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js"
      },
      "author": "Google LLC",
      "license": "Apache-2.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.17.1"
      }
    }

- Press CTRL+X, then Y to save the package.json file.
- Next, in the same directory, create a index.js file, and copy the following lines into it:
   > nano index.js
   ```const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const name = process.env.NAME || 'World';
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`);
  });
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`helloworld: listening on port ${port}`);
  });

- Press CTRL+X, then Y to save the index.js file.
- To containerize the sample app, create a new file named Dockerfile in the same directory as the source files, and add the following content:
   > nano Dockerfile
   ```
  # Use the official lightweight Node.js 12 image.
  # https://hub.docker.com/_/node
  FROM node:12-slim
  # Create and change to the app directory.
  WORKDIR /usr/src/app
  # Copy application dependency manifests to the container image.
  # A wildcard is used to ensure copying both package.json AND package-lock.json (when available).
  # Copying this first prevents re-running npm install on every code change.
  COPY package*.json ./
  # Install production dependencies.
  # If you add a package-lock.json, speed your build by switching to 'npm ci'.
  # RUN npm ci --only=production
  RUN npm install --only=production
  # Copy local code to the container image.
  COPY . ./
  # Run the web service on container startup.
  CMD [ "npm", "start" ]

- Press CTRL+X, then Y to save the Dockerfile file.
- Now, build your container image using Cloud Build by running the following command from the directory containing the Dockerfile. (Note the $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environmental variable in the command, which contains your lab's Project ID):
  > gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld
- **Cloud Build** is a service that executes your builds on GCP. It executes a series of build steps, where each build step is run in a Docker container to produce your application container (or other artifacts) and push it to Cloud Registry, all in one command.
- Once pushed to the registry, you will see a SUCCESS message containing the image name (gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/helloworld). The image is stored in Artifact Registry and can be re-used if desired.
- List all the container images associated with your current project using this command:
  > gcloud container images list
-  To run and test the application locally from Cloud Shell, start it using this standard docker command:
   > docker run -d -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld
- In the Cloud Shell window, click on Web preview and select Preview on port 8080.
This should open a browser window showing the "Hello World!" message. You could also simply use curl localhost:8080.
- **Note:** If the docker command cannot pull the remote container image then try running this: gcloud auth configure-docker

- Deploying your containerized application to Cloud Run is done using the following command adding your Project-ID:
   > gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld --allow-unauthenticated --region=$LOCATION
- The allow-unauthenticated flag in the command above makes your service publicly accessible.
- When prompted confirm the service name by pressing Enter.
- Wait a few moments until the deployment is complete.
- On success, the command line displays the service URL:

- Congratulations! You have just deployed an application packaged in a container image to Cloud Run.
- For this lab you used the gcloud command-line. Cloud Run is also available via Cloud Console.
From the Navigation menu, in the Serverless section, click Cloud Run and you should see your helloworld service listed:
- While Cloud Run does not charge when the service is not in use, you might still be charged for storing the built container image.
- You can either decide to delete your GCP project to avoid incurring charges, which will stop billing for all the resources used within that project, or simply delete your helloworld image using this command
   > gcloud container images delete gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld

- When prompted to continue type Y, and press Enter.
- To delete the Cloud Run service, use this command. When prompted to continue type Y, and press Enter
  > gcloud run services delete helloworld --region=us-central1
