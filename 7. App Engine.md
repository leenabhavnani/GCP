#### Notes

- App Engine, which is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale.
- With App Engine, there are no servers to provision or maintain.
- App Engine provides built-in services and APIs, like NoSQL datastores Memcache load balancing, health checks, application logging, and a user authentication API that’s common to most applications.
- There are two types of App Engine environments: **standard and flexible**
- Standard environment features include: Persistent storage with queries, sorting, and transactions Automatic scaling and load balancing Asynchronous task queues for performing work outside the scope of a request Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times or regular intervals And integration with other Google Cloud services and APIs
- The flexible environment supports microservices, authorization, SQL and NoSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging, search, versioning, security scanning, Memcache, and content delivery networks.a

- API Gateway enables you to provide secure access to your backend services through a well-defined REST API that is consistent across all of your services, regardless of the service implementation.
- Apigee API Management - Apigee API Management has a specific focus on business problems, like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics. So, instead of replacing a large, important application in one move, they can use Apigee API Management to peel off its services individually instead. This allows them to stand up microservices to implement each in turn until the legacy application can finally be retired.
- **Cloud Run** - a managed compute platform that lets you run stateless containers via web requests or Pub/Sub events.Cloud Run is serverless.
- It’s built on Knative, an open API and runtime environment built on Kubernetes that gives you freedom to move your workloads across different environments and platforms.
- Note that Cloud Run can only deploy images that are stored in Artifact Registry.
- You can use a container-based workflow, as well as a source-based workflow.bIf you use the source-based approach, you’ll deploy your source code, instead of a container image. Cloud Run then builds your source and packages the application into a container image for you.
- Today, Cloud run can allocate up to 4 vCPUs and 8 gigabytes of memory.
- **Cloud Source Repositories** - Cloud Source Repositories provides full-featured Git repositories hosted on Google Cloud that support the collaborative development of any application or service, including those that run on App Engine and Compute Engine.
- With Cloud Source Repositories, you can have any number of private Git repositories.
- **Cloud Functions** is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions that respond to cloud events, without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment.
