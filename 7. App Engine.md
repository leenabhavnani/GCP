#### Notes

- App Engine, which is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale.
- With App Engine, there are no servers to provision or maintain.
- App Engine provides built-in services and APIs, like NoSQL datastores Memcache load balancing, health checks, application logging, and a user authentication API thatâ€™s common to most applications.
- There are two types of App Engine environments: **standard and flexible**
- Standard environment features include: Persistent storage with queries, sorting, and transactions Automatic scaling and load balancing Asynchronous task queues for performing work outside the scope of a request Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times or regular intervals And integration with other Google Cloud services and APIs
- The flexible environment supports microservices, authorization, SQL and NoSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging, search, versioning, security scanning, Memcache, and content delivery networks.a
