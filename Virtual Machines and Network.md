#### Notes

- A virtual private cloud, or VPC, is a secure, individual, private cloud-computing model hosted within a public cloud â€“ like Google Cloud!
- Google VPC networks are global
- Resources can even be in different zones on the same subnet.
- With Compute Engine, users can create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.
- Compute Engine bills by the second with a one-minute minimum.
- **Sustained-use** discounts start to apply automatically to virtual machines the longer they run.
- **Committed-use discounts** A 57% discount off of normal prices in return for committing to a usage term of one year or three years.
- **Preemptible and Spot VMs**  Compute Engine has permission to terminate a job if its resources are needed elsewhere
- Preemptible VMs can only run for up to 24 hours at a time, but Spot VMs do not have a maximum runtime.
